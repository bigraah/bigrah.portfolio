                <p>
                    It set you back by ₹300. Sure, you saved ₹500 by getting it from Dmart not Amazon, but that's not what this is about.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is about what drove you to buy it in the first place.
                </p>
                
                <p class="font-bold italic">
                    It was probably the charm of not having to constantly get up to refill a smaller bottle.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I've been living with mine for two years now, using it religiously. Like most purchases, it starts off great. That initial rush of satisfaction, maybe even a touch of guilt-driven motivation to use it more, actually gets you drinking more water. You feel like you've made a smart choice.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But today something clicked. Staring at that last sip in the bottle, I dragged myself to fill it up. As I stood there watching the purifier slowly do its thing, my patience wore thin. "Who am I kidding? I won't need this much water right now," I thought, and walked away with just 1.5 liters in it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And that's when it hit me - if we still have to spend the same time filling up the bottle, does its size really help us drink more water? Have I just been fooling myself?
                </p>
